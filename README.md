Please complete the Survey after playing the Game 

# Introduction: 
I am Jamie Champion, a final year undergraduate studying Cyber Security at the University of Kent. This is my dissertation project contributing towards my final grade of my degree. I would like to extend a warm welcome to the world of "Pixel Protectors: Server Defence Saga," an innovative research project aiming to redefine how children aged 8-13 learn about online safety and cyber security. In this interactive journey, I invite you to become active participants in shaping an educational video game that blends entertainment and education seamlessly.
My primary goal is to co-create an engaging video game that not only captivates young minds but also imparts essential cyber security principles in a fun and exciting way. By involving parents, guardians, and the young players themselves in the development process, we aim to ensure the game not only entertains but becomes a powerful tool for instilling crucial knowledge about online safety. In "Pixel Protectors: Server Defence Saga," players assume the role of cyber guardians, defending a vital server from malicious attacks. The multi-faceted game-play ensures an immersive experience while reinforcing key cyber security concepts.
As technology becomes an integral part of children's lives, fostering a strong foundation in online safety is paramount. Traditional methods may not always resonate with the younger generation, and that's where this research steps in. We believe that by combining education with entertainment, we can create a game that not only teaches but also engages and excites young learners about the principles of cyber security.
I extend our heartfelt appreciation for considering participation in this research project.

# Expected Duration:
Your participation will entail assessing and providing feedback on the game developed by the researcher, titled Pixel Protectors, providing feedback on design, difficulty, engagement, and testing. Additionally, the researcher asks you to play and feedback a similar survey on three selected Cyber Security games that the research will use to help evaluate the game that has been created as part of this research - this in optional.  This will take place in your own leisure and time to full test and complete the survey will take no more than 20 to 25 minutes.

# Voluntary Participation:
Engaging in this research is entirely voluntary. You are under no obligation to partake, and you both retain the liberty to withdraw at any juncture without incurring any consequences.
